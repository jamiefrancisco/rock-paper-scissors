# Rock, Paper, Scissors

### Abstract:

Created an application that allows a user to play two variants of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer player. All of the gameplay is tracked in the data model and then separately displayed in the DOM.

### Installation Instructions:

Clone the repository to your local machine. The user can then interact with the application by opening the index.html file.

### Preview of App:

### Context:

This is the final solo project from Week 5-6 of Mod1 @ Turing. I spent around 40-50 hours working on this project. I had about a week to complete it.

### Learning Goals:

* Solidify and demonstrate my understanding of both DRY JavaScript and event delegation to handle similar event listeners
* Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
* Use my problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust myself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge


### Wins + Challenges:

* Win 1: Learning how to use mapping to refactor my determineOutcome function! This greatly reduced lines of code and made it much easier to understand the winning combinations for a given player.
* Win 2: Completing the entire project and keeping my learning goals in mind throughout.
* Challenge: Completely separating the data-model and the DOM. Making the game entirely playable within the console simply by manually inputting arguments into different functions. There was a lot of pseudocoding and console.log() that helped me work through this!
